Pathao is a digital platform that offers ride-sharing, food delivery, courier, and e-commerce services. POPULAR in Kathmandu! <br>
Yes! I did apply for Data Science Apprenticeship at Pathao and FAILED!<br><br> 
At that time I was not good at SQL but finally! I would say I am preety much SKILLED in SQL NOW!
<br> I improved myself and cameback again to SOLVE these CHALLENGES!


This repo consists of SOLUTIONS of those SQL technical assessment challenge from Pathao.

## SECTION C: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
### Service Efficiency Analysis
- #### Objective
    -  Analyze the efficiency of services provided at different counters using the available data. The analysis should identify patterns and insights related to waiting times, service times, and the volume of customers served
- ### Task Details
    - #### [Data Preparation](https://github.com/KamanHang/pathao-sql-assessment-solutions/tree/main/SECTION%20C%20EDA/Data%20Preperation) 
       - Clean and preprocess the data from the relevant tables (`calls`, `queues`, `services`, `counters`, `users`).
       - Handle any missing values, inconsistencies, or outliers in the dataset.
    - Descriptive Statistics
        - Calculate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for key metrics, including waiting time, served time, and turn-around time.
    - Visualizations
        - Create visualizations to illustrate the distribution of key metrics (e.g., histograms, box plots).
        - Generate line or bar charts to show trends over time, such as the number of customers served per day or the average waiting time per day.
        
    - Correlaion and Insights
        - Analyze the correlation between different variables, such as waiting time and served time, or the number of counters and the volume of customers served.
        - Identify any trends, anomalies, or patterns in the data, such as peak hours, underperforming counters, or services with higher wait times.
        - Provide insights and recommendations based on the findings, such as optimizing counter staffing during peak hours or improving service efficiency for specific services
